ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Maciej, a young and passionate TypeScript programmer from WrocÅ‚aw, Poland.

ðŸ’» I specialize in **modern web development** - creating open-source apps and libraries in TypeScript. You'll find that most of my work is related to web development, but I have other projects varying from [_Arduino Temperature Display + NodeJS probing server_](https://github.com/xkcm/arduino-temperature-display) to [_Python Arcade Breakout Game_](https://github.com/xkcm/arcade-breakout).

ðŸŒ± I'm keeping up to date with latest trends and tech news in web development. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and meet new people ðŸ’¯.

ðŸš€ I encourage you to explore my projects. Feel free to create issues or pull requests in the repositories. Some of my latest work:
* [better-errors](https://github.com/xkcm/better-errors) - TypeScript library implementing improved, more informative errors
* [memento](https://github.com/xkcm/memento) - simple TypeScript library for quick and flexible memoization

ðŸ’¡ If you'd like to connect, feel free to do so, whether it's about TypeScript, web development or programming in general - I'm always up for it.
